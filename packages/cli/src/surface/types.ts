 * same table. The two surfaces used to be independent transcriptions of the
 * same fifteen operations, which is why a parameter could be called `ref` in
 * one and `referenceLocale` in the other, with descriptions that had drifted
 * apart and nothing to notice.
 *
 * A parameter therefore has ONE name. Where the CLI used a shorter spelling it
 * survives as an alias, so `--ref` keeps working while the name both surfaces
 * agree on is `referenceLocale`. The only other latitude a surface has is to
 * hide a parameter it genuinely does not have — a CI gate flag means nothing
 * over MCP, a provider flag means nothing to a server that resolves its backend
 * from the environment — and hiding one has to be written down, which is what
 * the drift test reads.
